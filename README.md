# hello! :wave:
**Hi!** I'm @otidev (or just oti)! I like making programs, games, music and other stuff. I also really like rolling my own stuff for some reason.

I mainly code in C99, but sometimes other languages. I always like to make code that helps the community, or code that's just cool.

I'm looking forward to programming with the Github community! :smile:
