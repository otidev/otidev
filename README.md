# hello! :wave:
**Hi!** I'm @otidev (or just oti)! I like making programs, games, music and other stuff. I really like rolling my own stuff for some reason.

## Languages I know (in order of proficiency)
- C (my goto)
- C++ (not as much as C but I'm ok.)
- HTML/CSS (I can make a small website)
- Python/Javascript (50/50 prof.)

## Terminology
- **not ok**: The thing doesn't work or something along the lines of that.
- **still**: If it's still it's alright

I'm looking forward to programming with the Github community!!!11! :smile:
