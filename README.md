# hello! :wave:
**Hi!** I'm @otidev (or just oti)! I like making programs, games, music and other stuff. I also really like rolling my own stuff for some reason.

## Languages I know (in order of proficiency)
- C (my goto)
- C++ (not as much as C but I'm ok.)
- HTML/CSS (I can make a small website)
- Python/Javascript (50/50 prof.)

I'm looking forward to programming with the Github community!!!! :smile:
